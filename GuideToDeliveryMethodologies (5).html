    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured with a responsive sidebar for navigation and a main content area. The sidebar now includes a dedicated "Overview" section at the top, which, when selected, displays the methodology comparison chart and the methodology selector. This design allows users to quickly access interactive tools for high-level understanding and recommendations. The individual methodology details are now grouped under separate navigation links, maintaining a clean and focused view for deep dives into each methodology. Content for each methodology is organized into collapsible accordions. This interactive, multi-faceted approach supports both quick comparison/selection and deep exploration. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: 14 distinct software development methodologies. Goal: Compare methodologies to help users understand their differences and choose the right one. Viz/Presentation: An interactive scatter plot (using Chart.js on Canvas) compares methodologies on two axes: Approach (Prescriptive/Structured vs. Flexible/Adaptive) and Scale (Single Team vs. Enterprise). Interaction: Clicking a point on the chart navigates to that methodology's detailed view. Justification: A visual comparison is more intuitive and faster to grasp than reading through all 14 descriptions. It synthesizes the key differentiators into an easily digestible format. Library/Method: Chart.js for its simplicity and powerful canvas-based rendering. Textual content is rendered dynamically into accordion sections for detailed, on-demand exploration. New Feature: Methodology Selector. Goal: Help users choose a methodology based on their project's needs. Viz/Presentation: HTML form elements (dropdowns) for criteria input, textual recommendation output, and a new comparison matrix (HTML table with sortable columns). Interaction: User selects criteria, clicks a button, recommendation and matrix displayed. Users can click table headers to sort the matrix. Justification: Transforms passive consumption into active active problem-solving, directly addressing user's practical needs and providing a structured, interactive comparison. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for logic, HTML/Tailwind for UI. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
